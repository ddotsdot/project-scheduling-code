# multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling

This repository will soon provide the implementation which was used to generate the computational results presented in 
_Continuous-Time Formulations for Project Scheduling With Multiple Modes_ (currently under review) by <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8977-9414">David

## Optimization Tools

* __*jDecOR*__ ([0.2.1](https://maven.optimal-solution.org/service/rest/repository/browse/releases/org/optsol/jdecor/)) <br>
  This project is based on the [jdecor-pojo-template](https://github.com/OPTIMAL-SOLUTION-org/jdecor-pojo-template). __*jDecOR*__ framework helps to focus on the mathematical formulation and keeps boilerplate of mixed-integer programming at a minimum level.
* __*Google OR-Tools*__ ([9.2.997](https://developers.google.com/optimization/support/release_notes))
* __*SCIP*__ ([7.0.1](https://www.scipopt.org/doc-7.0.1/html/))
